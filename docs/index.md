# API Reference

The Odoo API follows the [*JSON-RPC 2.0 Specification*](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification). It accepts JSON-encoded request bodies and returns JSON-encoded responses.

This is an **unofficial** documentation of Odoo's JSON-RPC API. It has been initiated by [@Lanhild](https://github.com/Lanhild) and the community is free to contribute.

You can use this documentation as a reference point for any operation you wish to perform using the API of an Odoo instance.

Contributions are welcome whether it's by making changes to the definition itself or by [submitting suggestions](https://github.com/Lanhild/odoo-jsonrpc).
